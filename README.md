Welcome to Kapten's technical test.

This test consists of three parts:

1- Graph test.
2- Eta correction test.
3- Infinite pancakes house test.

The first and third tests are general algorithmic tests. To implement your solution, please edit only the cells that starts with the comment `Implement this function`

The second test is a data science test inspired from a real Kapten problem.

P.S 1: Make sure that you understood well all the statements before implementing your solution.

P.S 2: You need jupyter notebook for this test. You can check this [link](http://jupyter.org/install) for more information about this tool.

P.S 3: If you have any question, please do not hesitate to mail our recruiters.

Good work !!
